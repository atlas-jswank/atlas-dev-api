    lyrics: `[Verse]
The night whispers secrets we knew,
Under twilight's soft, velvet hue,
In a city painted in blue,
We danced 'round the truth we flew.

[Verse 2]
Lamp posts glow with memories sweet,
As shadows and dreams softly meet,
Every step we take is so fleet,
To the syncopated heartbeat.

[Chorus]
Our love's a gentle, wistful tune,
Like a rose in the midday bloom,
Though fleeting like a smoke plume,
It's a love that leaves no room.

[Verse 3]
Stars overhead wink their bright eye,
As the moon sighs a fond goodbye,
We'll let this moment, too, pass by,
In this melancholy sky.

[Bridge]
Blue echoes on the midnight air,
Love caressed with a tender flair,
Through the darkness, hearts laid bare,
In the silence, a fervent prayer.

[Chorus]
Our love's a gentle, wistful tune,
Like a rose in the midday bloom,
Though fleeting like a smoke plume,
It's a love that leaves no room.`,

    lyrics: `[Verse]
Moonlight dances on the ocean's face
Waves sing stories of a timeless place
Soft whispers in the night keep pace
With echoing dreams in endless space

[Verse 2]
Starfish conjure a celestial relay
Coral gardens where the sea nymphs play
Currents carry whispers far away
In the heart of the deep we stay

[Chorus]
Tidal drift takes me home
In the serene vast unknown
Flowing peace where I roam
In every wave I'm not alone

[Verse 3]
Shelter in the shells they hold
Secrets gleam like sunlit gold
In the depths where tales unfold
Ancient whispers softly told

[Bridge]
Breathing rhythms of the sea
Echoes in tranquility
Softly calling out to me
In the flow where I am free

[Verse 4]
Gentle sway of unseen hands
Guides me through these liquid lands
Boundless love in ocean's strands
Forever in this place I stand`,

    lyrics: `[Verse]
Staring at the ceiling shadows creep
Whispers of past lives we couldn't keep
Echoes of dreams we drowned in the deep
Fading shadows haunt the places we sleep

[Verse 2]
Broken promises like shattered glass
Memories scatter on a troubled path
Truth in a bottle we dared not ask
Fading shadows slip through our grasp

[Chorus]
We used to shine like stars in the night
Now we wander lost without a light
Fading shadows in the dim twilight
We reach for a day that’s out of sight

[Verse 3]
Dust settles on the words we never spoke
Tangled in silence our connection broke
Eyes that once sparkled now cloak
Fading shadows cloak us like a joke

[Bridge]
Fighting the ghosts that we left behind
In the ruins of the life we designed
Searching for solace we can't find
Fading shadows clouding our mind

[Chorus]
We used to shine like stars in the night
Now we wander lost without a light
Fading shadows in the dim twilight
We reach for a day that’s out of sight`,

Stars ignite in dark twilight
Mind unbound in endless flight
Echoes lost in cosmic stream
Waking souls in silent dream

[Verse 2]
Nebulae whisper tales untold
Galaxies blazin' bright and bold
Planet dust in my weary hand
Seekin' truths in unknown lands

[Chorus]
Driftin' far we lose our chains
Feel the pull away from plains
Gravity fades hearts aligned
Journey deep into the mind

[Verse 3]
Wormholes twist through timeless skies
Mystic trails in my eyes
Comets sing in cosmic hum
Worlds collide in astral drum

[Bridge]
Visions steeped in lunar blue
Chasin' shadows ever true
Voices call from distant edge
Life reborn on stardust ledge

[Verse 4]
Light years pass in fleeting sigh
Shooting stars in nighttime high
Dreams consumed by restless night
Caught within the fire's light`,

City lights are gleamin'
Streets alive tonight
Rhythms in the hustle
Groove's feelin' just right (oo-yeah!)
People movin'
Shakin'
Under neon glow
Life's a funky journey
Let's go with the flow

[Verse 2]
Taxi horns are beepin'
Music in the air (uh-huh!)
Everybody's vibin'
No one has a care
Sidewalks full of stories
Laughter in the breeze
Feel the city pulsin'
Bring you to your knees

[Chorus]
Come on
Feel the rhythm of this urban serenade (oh-oh!)
Every corner hummin'
Where the joy is made
We got the groove
Yeah! Get up and play
Let the night take over
Hear the city sway

[Verse 3]
Food trucks on the corner
Smells that make you swoon (mm-mm!)
Dancers on the street will have you tappin’ soon
Couples locked in step to that city beat
Living for the moment
Life is oh so sweet (so sweet!)

[Bridge]
High-rise towers glowin'
Stars begin to peek
Find a hidden jazz club
Secrets start to speak (shh!)
Melodies and memories
Blend into the night
Urban serenade
The city’s pure delight

[Chorus]
Come on
Feel the rhythm of this urban serenade (oh-oh!)
Every corner hummin'
Where the joy is made
We got the groove
Yeah! Get up and play

    lyrics: `[Verse]
In the quiet of the evening
Shadows start to sway
Underneath the ancient oak where the memories lay
Her voice was like a whisper
Caught within the leaves
Love lost in the twilight
Carried on the breeze

[Verse 2]
We danced by the river
Where the willows softly bend
Promises like raindrops
We thought would never end
But the tides of time were stronger
Washed away our dreams
Left us with the echoes
Of forgotten summer schemes

[Chorus]
Whispers in the wind
Calling out her name
Gone with the night
Nothing is the same
Haunting all my days
Can't escape the sound
Of whispers in the wind
In my heart they're bound

[Verse 3]
The fields are ever golden
Same as they have been
But now the sun sets lower
On dreams that might have been
I walk the path of silence
Where we used to roam
Every sigh
A longing
For the love I've known

[Chorus]
Whispers in the wind
Calling out her name
Gone with the night
Nothing is the same
Haunting all my days
Can't escape the sound
Of whispers in the wind
In my heart they're bound

[Bridge]
Stars above are weeping
They know the lost embrace
Moonlight through the branches
A glimpse of her grace
But morning always shatters
The dreams from yesternight
Leaving me with whispers
Fading with the light`,

Neon lights set the sky afire
We chase the night hearts caught in a wire
Sweat drops pearling while we move as one
Electric fever we’re the chosen ones

[Verse 2]
Feel the pulse in the rhythm of the beat
Lost in the crowd our senses meet
Lights are flashing shadows intertwine
Electric fever lovers lost in time

[Chorus]
We’re electrified in the neon glow
Time’s a broken clock when we let it go
Feel the charge the sparks between our dreams
Electric fever nothing as it seems

[Bridge]
Rising tension tempting every soul
Arpeggios take control
Building up to a cosmic eruption
Electric fever feeds the seduction

[Verse 3]
Syncopated beats make the night ignite
Hearts colliding in blinding light
Voices echo through the endless nights
Electric fever sets our spirits alight

[Chorus]
We’re electrified in the neon glow
Time’s a broken clock when we let it go
Feel the charge the sparks between our dreams
Electric fever nothing as it seems`,

Electric wildflower I break the mold
Waves crash inside me I won’t fall
Unapologetic bold fierce and bold

With every color I embrace my light
Petals dancing under the moon's glow
Stars above whisper my inner might
Free spirit come to life watch me flow

I’m an electric wildflower can’t you see
Bending rules and living wild and free
I bloom in chaos that's where I thrive
In my own garden I come alive

[Verse 3]
Raindrops kiss my face in the haze
I find strength in nature’s embrace
Roots run deep through endless ways
A force of beauty pure and uncaged

[Bridge]
Hear my song carried by the breeze
A melody that flows with ease
No chains no bounds just skies and trees
In my world there's only me

I’m an electric wildflower can’t you see
Bending rules and living wild and free
I bloom in chaos that's where I thrive
In my own garden I come alive`,

Golden moments slip away
In this endless lazy day

Footprints fade on sandy shore
Echoes from a distant roar
Whispers of the ocean's tale
In the golden haze we sail

Fleeting moments hold us tight
Stars will guide us through the night
Every memory will stay
In this golden summer haze

Laughter fills the twilight air
Dreams we chase without a care
Moonlight dances on the waves
As the night and day misbehave

Fleeting moments hold us tight
Stars will guide us through the night

In this golden summer haze

Time may fade these autumn days
But in our hearts the golden stays
We'll remember our sweet phase

Dreams like chains hold us tight
Whispers echo endless fight
Time to rise into the light

Walls are closing pressing hard
Voices silent battle's scarred
Stand together we're unbarred
Truth of freedom disregard

[Chorus]
Shatter the silence scream and shout
Tear down the barriers break them out
No more hiding no more doubt
We'll stand tall when walls fall out

Darkness can't persist for long
Light within us far too strong
Pass the torch the final song
We'll be right where we belong

[Verse 4]
Every wound we've ever known
Every fear we've ever sown
It's the path that we’ve outgrown
Braving storms no more alone

Echoes fade in twilight's gleam
Live the truth beyond the dream
Change the course shift the stream
Force the dawn no longer scheme`,
